---
The taskcluster-github service now correctly uses the `github.bot_username` configuration to look up the latest status for a branch.
Deployments of Taskcluster should double-check that this value is set correctly; see the [deployment docs](https://docs.taskcluster.net/docs/manual/deploying/github) for details.
